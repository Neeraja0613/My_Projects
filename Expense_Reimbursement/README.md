# Expense Reimbursement System  

**Short description**  
The Expense Reimbursement System automates employee expense submission, approval, and tracking using SharePoint lists, Power Automate flows, Outlook notifications, and Excel reports. It reduces manual work and ensures transparency.  

**Tools**  
- Microsoft SharePoint (lists for expense claims)  
- Power Automate (flows for approvals and tracking)  
- Outlook (email notifications)  
- Excel (reporting and summaries)  

**What it does**  
- Employees submit expense claims  
- Managers approve or reject requests  
- Automatic email notifications sent on status updates  
- Admins track expenses and generate Excel reports  

**How to import / view**  
1. Open `Exports/ExpenseApprovalFlow-v1.zip` and import into Power Automate (My Flows → Import).  
2. Open `Exports/ExpensesList.csv` and create a SharePoint list (or manually create lists using the column names in Documentation).  
3. View `Demo/demo.mp4` for a walkthrough.
