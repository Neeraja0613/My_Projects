# Resource Management System  

**Short description**  
The Resource Management System streamlines the allocation, tracking, and utilization of resources within an organization. It improves efficiency, ensures transparency, and minimizes resource conflicts.  

**Tools**  
- Microsoft SharePoint (lists for managing resources like teachers availability, books availability, food stocks)  
- Power Automate (flows for assignment, updates, and notifications)  
- Outlook (automated email alerts)  
- Excel (reporting and analysis)  

**What it does**  
- Allows employees to request resources  
- Admins/managers can approve, reject, or reassign resources  
- Automatic notifications for assignment, return, or overdue resources  
- Provides usage history and analytics in Excel  

**How to import / view**   
1. Open the required SharePoint list exports from the `Exports/` folder:  
   - `TeachersList.csv` (employee requests)  
   - `BooksList.csv` (tracking books)  
   - `FoodList.csv` (tracking food stocks)  
   Create corresponding SharePoint lists (or manually configure lists using the column names in Documentation).  
2. View `Demo/demo.mp4` for a walkthrough of the system.  

**Files**  
- `Screenshots/` — images of flows, requests, and approval screens  
- `Exports/` — exported flows and SharePoint list templates
- `Demo/` — video demo of the system
